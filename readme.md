#Please note:

The original input shapefile **(SouthGeorgiaBound.shp)** was converted to geojson in both ArcGIS and using MapShaper.org tools. The shapefile was then converted to topojson format using the MapShaper conversion. In all cases (converted from ArcGIS or the MapShaper website), the geojson and topojson files retained their ".json" file extensions by default. The file names below indicate the type of file format for the respective .json-type files.
